      <h2 id="instructions">How to Play</h2>
      <p><strong>Drunk Santa! You must save all the Kitties from the aggressive Wasps!</strong>
        <br>
        Pick up all the Kitties that are being swarmed by Wasps to gain points.
        <br>
        If the Wasps sting you, you will lose a life. Wasps only attack what's in front of them.
        <br>
        You have a gun to defend yourself, but it might not be easy to shoot a flying Wasp. Reloading will take a few seconds, so be wise with your shots.
        <br>
        <strong>And beware of not shooting any Kitties!</strong>
        <br>
        Eat Mushrooms to recover health, you have maximum of 3 lives!
